## Introduction

*Tap It!* is a simple tapping Android game that demonstrates Google Sign-In and the Play Games Services (Achievements and Leaderboards).


## Usage

To make the app run modify the file games-ids.xml (in app/src/main/res/values/) following the instructions provided there.  
Afterwards, create your own "google-services.json" configuration file from the second step of this page: [Sign-In for Android](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start) and copy it to the /app folder.


## Working app

The last version of the app can be downloaded for free from: [Tap It!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyclopsdev.tapit)  
My other apps can also be downloaded from: [CyclOps Development apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=CyclOps+Development).
